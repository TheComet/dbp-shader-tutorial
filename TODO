IMMEDIATE
- Write lots and lots of examples for every tutorial
- Grammar correction
- Tutorials are sloppy. The potential is there for them to be explained much better
- Maybe reorganise the tutorials? Is there a better structure?
- Images! Lots of images should be inserted into the tutorials, illustrating what's being described.
